      I'm **Wil Gibbs** - a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University (ASU) interested in Systems Security. 
      I currently work at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) under [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://rev.fish/) who is my primary advisor, but I also work closely with [Dr. Adam Doup√©](https://adamdoupe.com/), [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), and [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/). 
      I have a strong interest in anything binary analysis related with most of my research focus on static analysis. 
      I am the Co-Lead of the Shellphish founded [AIxCC](https://aicyberchallenge
      .com/) team alongside Lukas Dresel where we won $3 Million in total from DARPA and became finalists in the AIxCC competition with our Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) [ARTIPHISHELL](https://support.shellphish.net/).

      When I'm not doing Research, I am competing in ethical hacking competitions called CTFs! 
      I am a member of the internationally known CTF team [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) which routinely competes in DEFCON CTF and am a proud **captain emeritus** (2018-2024). 
      I started the ASU based CTF team *pwndevils* which has transitioned into the [ASU Hacking Club](http://asuhacking.club/) and pipelines talented hackers directly into Shellphish. 
      I try my best at pwn and rev based challenges (with a sprinkle of web) under the handle *Clasm* when competing. 
      I also successfully submitted bugs to pwn2own alongside the SEFCOM T0 team in 2022 and 2023.
