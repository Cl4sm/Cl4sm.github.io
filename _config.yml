  I am currently a research assistant at ASU's SEFCOM, working on applying Reaching Definition Analysis to discover potential command injections in executables. My previous research includes topics in the mobile space. Specifically, how native libraries are used in Android applications and their security mechanisms. I also lead a Capture The Flag (CTF) team, Shellphish, which participates in many cyber-security challenges and competitions throughout the year.
